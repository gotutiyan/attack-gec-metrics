In the case of Huntington 's disease , a lethal genetic disorder , the result is also desired by family members and potential mates as it would help them to make important decisions , such as whether or not to have children or abort an affected fetus .
However , some may argue that the benefits of surveillance technology actually compensate for the concerns about privacy .
The negative effects of aging are major problems which the aging population is facing As people get older , it becomes more difficult for them to complete their daily tasks due to the loss of muscles and strength and health problems such as diabetes , cancer and dementia are commonly found .
The biggest problem will be that your friends and family will think you are in need of psychiatric attention because you eat weird and live a little differently , and because you might also not invest in things like television sets because you discover exercise and the outdoors are much more invigorating and healthful .
It could be difficult to feel how many things have been changed in our daily life .
There are so many people who find it hard to concentrate on their work .
Skilled psychologists , famous sociologists and eminent MPs try to convince us that this is not happening to any greater degree than in the past , but we just hear about it more through the media ; However , this is a pitiful and awful lie as so many cases of violence to minors have never taken place in other periods of history .
I agree with those who have expressed their concerns about the risks the observers themselves are facing .
While I understand that not everyone will always be happy with a decision , the government should make a decision that will be beneficial for everyone , not just one group .
We can not just let history be forgotten .
But I think that it is hard to apply to humans , because there are some ethical issues we will have to resolve .
It is only after we tell them will they start paying attention to their health .
In many cases , parents will need to be involved in deciding whether their son or daughter gets a credit card before they turn 21 .
Most importantly , consumers have a right to choose whether to buy or not to buy genetically modified food by themselves .
If we get serious about it , maybe someone will think twice about deciding to murder someone .
You can count on us to support you , but you can also count on us , if it is necessary , to keep a close eye on the decisions that are being taken .
Thus , a carrier should not be obligated to tell his relatives about his genetic risk .
Therefore , parents who choose not to immunize their children place other children at risk for infection .
However , the reticence of one 's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health .
While some argue that the adoption of RFID is a violation of human privacy , it indeed helps to protect the safety of families , the public and to identify patients .
In my opinion , the right of his or her relatives to know the risk and possibility to save lives should not be denied by the person .
While the obligation for a carrier to tell his relatives may be considered as a breach of privacy , not telling them at all is tantamount to negligence , especially if the genetic condition is known to be hereditary .
For this purpose , the presentation will be divided into four sections .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know about one 's genetic condition is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
However , individuals ' decisions can be influenced by the fear of developing an inherited genetic disorder and the result of avoiding close relationships with their family members ( Procter 2002 ) .
Therefore , parents who choose not to immunize their children place other children at risk for infection .
However , even after the symptoms have cleared up , people may still carry the virus and infect others up to three days after their own symptoms have stopped .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know about one 's genetic condition is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
Many customers are also better informed about procedures and precautions ( including confirming that their doctor is an authorized surgeon ) .
However , this result of family members being informed should not be a reason to stop the individual from informing the family members .
In many cases , parents will need to be involved in deciding whether their son or daughter gets a credit card before they turn 21 .
Firstly , a known genetic risk carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives because of their right to know .
All people who work should be able to take their kids to the doctor without worrying if they will have enough money to buy food for the next week .
This is because one might not get the mutated genes .
When an employee is diagnosed to have certain genetic disorders , the employer may not want to retain the employee .
A long time ago , I remember reading ( in the NY Times ) a statement by a former public school principal .
He has a girlfriend and a 2 - year - old son .
My father was diagnosed with this horrible disease and died very shortly thereafter .
Similarly , if the disease is untreatable , the family member could make a decision to abort the child so that the disease will not affect the next generation .
Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease .
At the same time , she and her husband discovered they would not be able to have children without medical help .
After his parents divorced , he stayed with his mother , but she remarried and divorced again .
Even though some say that by revealing the result , one 's family will also get depressed and this will affect the whole family ,
Although it is the individual 's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
Even though a positive result on a genetic test only shows a higher risk of developing the disease , such information is very important and crucial as knowing about one 's predisposition to such a disease may help to reduce the risk of developing it as one would then seek to control one 's lifestyle as environmental factors play an important role in the onset of certain genetic diseases .
Hence , advocates may argue that if an individual holds the final say , yet chooses to withhold the information from their family members , this could have serious implications on the other family members susceptible to a particular disease .
Conversely , today because of the development of technology , people do not come into contact with employees .
Currently , many people are talking about whether we need the government to help us , since we can solve important problems by ourselves or with help from other family members .
Therefore , it is ethically wrong to invade other people 's privacy and there is a need to ban surveillance technology to protect our own rights .
Although it is the individual 's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
There are two main reasons that account for my argument .
Actually , 6 month ago one of my English conversation teachers gave me the information of other distributer who is based on United State .
Although it is the individual 's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
The best way to have ethics in government is for the media to do investigative journalism , and for Americans to voe out unethical behavior .
because people who know the couple in different positions gather and share their memories .
In the case of incurable diseases , knowing one 's condition could influence many family planning decisions and other life choices .
Due to his or her fear of rejection , he or she to returns to conformity .
Moreover , the most horrible thing is that they can not thinking creatively especially for design process .
One reason for revealing the result to family members is that the result is not only applicable to the individual but also to his family members , as they may also have inherited the disease .
However , the reticence of one 's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health .
This is because the relative may go for genetic testing and if one is confirmed to have the disease , he or she will not continue in his or her profession and thus will not expose others to danger .
Judging by their play last season , it would seem that they will be ready to take on the challenge , but only time will tell .
No matter how much we encourage young people to care for their parents , it 's still their personal choice ; the society or the government can not force them to do their part .
Being able-bodied and in good health , children should not forget their parents ' kindness towards them .
The children rely the parent to live .
When the property is decided too early , there are many elderly people who worry that their children will not take care of them .
Actually , teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children .
This is because the carrier thinks that revealing the result of the test will affect the life of the whole family .
While some argue that under certain circumstances , the non-disclosure of relevant genetic information brings harm to the individual and a third party , it in fact helps to protect an individual 's right to confidentiality , safeguard against discrimination and reduce psychological stress .
Evidently , the aging process has been made easier by technological developments .
There also exists some probability of wrong testing .
As accepting the occurrence or increased risk of developing genetic disorders is rather emotionally burdensome , affected patients should reveal the truth to their family members who are able to provide additional care and companionship .
Although it is the individual 's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .
While some argue that under certain circumstances , the non-disclosure of relevant genetic information brings harm to the individual and a third party , it in fact helps to protect an individual 's right to confidentiality , safeguard against discrimination and reduce psychological stress .
The Individual Requesting Genetic Testing Should Have the Final Say in whether to Reveal the Results of Such Testing
With medical technology advances today , genetic testing has been commonly used to detect any disorders or diseases that are present in our genes .
Nowadays , genetic testing can provide someone with information regarding his or her genetic condition .
If everything works out , it should be a great time .
For addicts , this problem is more dangerous , because basically they may not control spending money even though they are insolvent .
In this case , third parties such as doctors should not reveal the results , as doctors are usually more concerned with alerting the person of the possible chances of contracting the genetic disease , rather than the possible negative impacts this news may bring to the person .
When an employee is diagnosed to have certain genetic disorders , the employer may not want to retain the employee .
Different mothers , same fathers The difference is that we are the same in so many ways , unlike my other siblings .
Therefore there is nothing to be shy for or be afraid of .
An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out whether or not his body houses a defective gene .
In general , if at risk relatives can anticipate the disease , measures may be taken to prevent it .
In addition , they can prevent the next generation from getting the same disorder as well .
Some people think that when they face difficulties , they can rely on their family or friends to solve their problems .
Considering the preparation for the future of his or her relatives , the carrier should tell his or her relatives about the disease or disorder .
Men need to give the doctors a chance to utilize the new treatments by having a regular check up .
However , the reticence of one 's genetic test result would mean that family members are unaware of the possible danger to their health .

And after the defendant — accused of ordering her husband ’s murder in 2007 and facing life in prison — decided to testify , the judge forbade her to explain why she did certain peculiar things , like buying a spy camera and secretly recording conversations .
Just when people were worrying that she might commit suicide from the shame of what her husband did , the police found drugs in her apartment .
They had no emotion .
In fact , carriers of certain genetic diseases do not necessarily exhibit the characteristics controlled by defective genes .
It is because genetic testing can not predict how severely one person will be affected by the disordered genes .
Even though a positive result on a genetic test only shows a higher risk of developing the disease , such information is very important and crucial as knowing about one 's predisposition to such a disease may help to reduce the risk of developing it as one would then seek to control one 's lifestyle as environmental factors play an important role in the onset of certain genetic diseases .
Over the past decade , consumers have become more concerned about their health and are increasingly inclined to invest in DTC nutrigenetic tests to assess their risk of disease and obtain dietary advice .
In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as to whether the results should be revealed or not as the benefits of revealing the results is substantial to the individual and his family , and it can not be assumed that the individual will be able to act responsibly to his family in the face of his own interests .
Although it is the individual 's right to choose not to disclose their genetic information to his or her relatives , in my opinion , he or she is obligated and responsible to disclose the said genetic information for several reasons .

The same could be said about citizen participation , which must deal with the fact that citizens are increasingly ignored in community life and decision making .

It is understandable that older people often require more medical care , but they need not remain in the hospital for this care .
Besides being able to receive family support , letting others know about one 's genetic condition is also a form of relieving unnecessary stress .
